- **Yearly Overview**: View bills by year with sorting options (date, payee)
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive pie chart showing year-to-date spending distribution
- **Dark Mode**: User-friendly dark mode toggle for comfortable viewing
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite database for reliable data storage

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of web applications

### Steps
1. Configure the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   services:
   app:
     container_name: BillTrak
     restart: unless-stopped
     image: ghcr.io/solo-web-works/billtrak:main

     ports:
       - "8888:80" # Map port 8888 on the host to port 80 in the container.  Change the left side to change the host port.

     volumes:
       # Mount the current directory for live development
       # - .:/var/www/html
       - ./data/bills.db:/var/www/html/data/bills.db # Bind mount to persist SQLite data
      ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   cp bills-sample.db ./data/bills.db
   ```

3. Start the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8888
   ```

## Usage
1. **Adding a Bill**:
   - Fill out the "Add New Payment" form with date, payee, amount, and optional details
   - Click "Add Bill" to save

2. **Adding a Payee**:
   - Use the "Add New Payee" form in the sidebar
   - Enter the payee name and click "Add Payee"

3. **Viewing Bills**:
   - Bills are automatically displayed for the selected year
   - Use the sort dropdown to organize bills by date or payee

4. **Editing a Bill**:
   - Click the "Edit" button on any bill
   - Modify the details in the popup modal and click "Save"

5. **Viewing Analytics**:
   - The YTD Chart section shows a pie chart of spending distribution
   - The YTD Summary displays total amounts by payee

## Configuration
The application can be configured through the following methods:

1. **Port Configuration**:
   Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to change the host port:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "8888:80" # Change 8888 to your preferred port
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:
   The SQLite database file is located at `data/bills.db`. This location should be bind mounted in your compose file for data persistence.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Add environment variables to the `docker-compose.yml` file for advanced configuration:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PHP_ERROR_REPORTING=E_ALL
     - PHP_DISPLAY_ERRORS=On
   ```
